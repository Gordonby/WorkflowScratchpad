# Workflow Scratchpad

This repo is intended to show GitHub action workflow patterns.

## Summary

Name | Summary | Descrption / Typical Use Case
---|---|---
[Fork Validate](.github/workflows/ForkValidate.yml) | Shows checking for a forked PR, and conditionally taking actions such as adding a comment to the PR. | Forked PR's cannot access Repo secrets when they run - so this leads into handling Pull Requests from forks differently where your workflow actions leverage secrets as part of the process to validate PR's
[Matrix-iterate](.github/workflows/matrix-iterate.yml) | Shows dymamically building an array which then feeds a Matrix Strategy. | Taking multiple files and validating their contents. Each files pass/fail needs to be respresented in the GitHub workflow step log.
[Check-File-On-Pr](.github/workflows/checkChangedFile.yml)| Fires on PR. Reviews changes to a specific file. Parses json, and if differences in the json document uses the `GH CLI` to add a review to the PR.
